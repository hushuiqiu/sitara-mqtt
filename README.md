# Sitara MQTT
A MQTT Client based off of [Eclipse Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org). The MQTT protocol provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for Internet of Things messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers.

## Examples
* `MqttExample` shows a basic MQTT Client communicating with the Mosquitto test server at [http://test.mosquitto.org/](http://test.mosquitto.org/).
